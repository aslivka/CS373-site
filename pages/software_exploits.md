## Week 4 - Software Vulnerabilities and Exploits              
### Introduction
We will cover some major types of software exploits used for gaining unathorized access to computer systems. 
After that, I included a summary of a Stack overflow exploit Lab, with screenshots and commands.

### Manipulating Software 
*	Finding “bugs” which alter behavior of the program. They are commonly referred to as ***exploits***.
*	Taking advantage of a misconfiguration or poor programming practice

### Flaw Classes and Vulnerabilities
*	***Configuration*** – weak password
*	***Logic*** – authorization issues
*	***Storage*** – inadequate encryption
*	***Input validation*** - memory corruption and injection

### Memory corruption 
This is accessing memory in an invalid way which results in an undefined behavior (which we’re looking to control)
Types
*	Lifetime control 
*	Uninitialized memory
*	Array index calculations
*	buffer length calculations 



```
attrib +r +s +h c:\qusla.exe
```
Then, it adds qusla.exe to Windows startup by creating the appropriate registry key at HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
*	Finally, it changes start page for Internet explorer to ***http://www.3392.cn***.

* It created ***Dx.bat*** file, a batch file that runs commands
